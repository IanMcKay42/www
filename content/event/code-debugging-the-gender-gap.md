_CODE: Debugging The Gender Gap_ exposes the dearth of American female and minority 
software engineers and explores the reasons for this gender gap and digital divide.

Tech jobs are growing three times faster than our colleges are producing computer science 
graduates. By 2020, there will be one million unfilled software engineering jobs in the USA. 
Through compelling interviews, artistic animation and clever flashpoints in popular culture, 
_CODE_ examines the reasons why more girls and people of color are not seeking out 
opportunities in computer science and explores how cultural mindsets, stereotypes, 
educational hurdles, and sexism all play roles in this national crisis. Expert voices from the 
worlds of tech, psychology, science, and education are intercut with personal stories of women 
who are engaged in the fight to challenge complacency in the tech industry and have their 
voices heard. _CODE_ aims to inspire change in mindsets, in the educational system, in startup 
culture and in the way women see themselves in the field of coding.

Computer code forms the foundation of modern society. Cell phones, apps, navigation systems, 
medical equipment, banking, movie animation… are all driven by code. The more diverse a 
team of coders is, the broader their perspective of society’s needs, which can ultimately result 
in products that serve a greater breadth of humanity.

_CODE_ takes a hard look at the pipeline question in technology: why aren’t there more women 
and minority graduates in computer science? What is stopping them from getting to the 
threshold? _CODE_ follows the various challenges faced by a new generation of women 
programmers and the ingenious ways they are using their skills, drive, intellect and vision to 
disrupt the traditional, male-dominated tech world.

_CODE_ looks to the past, delving into the history of computing to highlight women like Ada 
Lovelace and Grace Hopper who set the stage for today’s technology. _CODE_ acknowledges that 
women have been an important part of computing since the genesis of computers, but have 
since been written out of this history.

_CODE_ is not afraid to ask the hard questions and does so with intelligence and a sense of 
humor, examining our culture from high (the views of former Harvard President Larry Summers
on innate ability) to low (an app called "Titstare" presented to a room of tech heavyweights).

A blend of personal stories, expert voices, innovative animation, historic discoveries, and 
moments from popular culture are complemented with a cutting edge musical score and 
bolstered by a strong sense of purpose. _CODE_ reflects, at its heart, the interconnectedness of 
the stories, the web, and by proxy, the shared vision of a new, more democratic community 
made possible by the inclusion of more women in code.
